USSD stands for Unstructured Supplementary Service Data what is a capability of GSM mobile phone much like the Short Message Service (SMS)

USSD information is sent from mobile handset directly to an application platform handling service. USSD establishes a real time session between mobile handsets and the application handling a service. The concept of real time session is very useful for constructing an interactive menu driven application.

`USSD Gateway` is built on Mobicents SS7 and Mobicents JSLEE Server. It offers RESTful HTTP interface that allows web developers to build interactive apps for feature mobile phones.


`USSD Gateway` is lead by [TeleStax, Inc.](http://www.telestax.com) and developed collaboratively by a community of individual and enterprise contributors.
